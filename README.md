## Motivation
In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets is crucial for informed decision-making across all levels of an organization. However, this process often requires a deep understanding of complex querying languages and coding skills, which can be a significant barrier for many users. This project aims to democratize data analysis by building an intuitive, user-friendly system that empowers users to generate insights from their data using natural language inputs and provide high quality visual and textual insights based on the data provided.



## Objective
Build a system which takes natural language as input and generate insights from the data for users across the board without the requirement of writing complex queries and code
Build the data pipeline which loads all csv files into SQL DB and utilises LangChain toolkit to connect with the DB
Develop a chat based application that has an ability to converse with the user and generate insights on the go using frameworks such as LangChain, streamlit
